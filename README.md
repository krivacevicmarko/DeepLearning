# Project 1: Application of Convolutional Neural Networks for Color Recognition
This project focuses on applying Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to recognize the dominant color in an image. The implementation involves:

Dataset preprocessing: The dataset (House Plant Species) is analyzed, cleaned, and prepared for training.
Data analysis: At least six statistical and visualization methods are applied to explore dataset characteristics.
CNN Model Design and Training:
The model is built using TensorFlow/Keras.
Multiple CNN architectures are tested, with at least three versions evaluated.
Performance metrics such as loss and accuracy are recorded and compared.
Evaluation and Optimization:
The best model is selected based on evaluation results.
Fine-tuning is applied to improve accuracy.
Experiments are conducted to compare model variations.
This project applies key deep learning concepts, including convolutional layers, activation functions, and optimization techniques, with a focus on image classification using CNNs.

# Project 2: LLM Agent-Based Research Assistance System
This project involves designing a multi-agent system based on Large Language Models (LLMs) to assist researchers in gathering and structuring information. The implementation includes:

Problem Decomposition:
The research process is broken down into at least four subproblems, each assigned to a dedicated LLM agent.
Agent Design:
Agents are implemented using LLM models, without relying on external APIs (e.g., OpenAI API).
Each agent is optimized through fine-tuning or advanced prompt engineering.
At least one agent integrates an external tool (e.g., an API for retrieving information).
Agent Communication and Task Handover:
Linear and dynamic handover mechanisms are implemented to transfer tasks between agents.
The system ensures efficient cooperation between agents to generate coherent research reports.
Implementation and Evaluation:
The system is tested with sample research topics.
The accuracy and coherence of generated reports are evaluated.
This project highlights the practical application of LLM-based multi-agent systems, integrating sequential models and external tools to create a structured and interactive research assistant.
